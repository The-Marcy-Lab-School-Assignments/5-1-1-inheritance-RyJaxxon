# Question

What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer

Polymorphism is the manipulation of an already existing function that is part of a original or 'parent' class. When we extend that class we can change the functionality of this already existing function to do something else while not affecting the parent classes version of that function.

```js
class Hi {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  sayHi(name) {
    console.log(`Hi ${name}`);
  }
}
class Bye extends Hi {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name);
  }
  sayHi(name) {
    console.log(`Bye ${name}`); // POLYMORPHISM BABY
  }
}
```
